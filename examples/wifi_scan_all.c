/*
 *  This example makes passive scan of all the networks on interface.
 *  Passive scanning may take a while and your link may be unusable for other programs during the scan.
 *  For the above reason you should not call it too often (e.g. once a second) unless you don't mind side effects.
 * 
 *  Triggering a scan needs persmission. The program will fail with operation not supported error message if you don't have them.
 *  You can use sudo for testing.
 * 
 *  Program expects wireless interface as argument, e.g:
 *  wifi-scan-all wlan0
 *
